 * broadcast spectrum metadata, and make the data available for reading via RDMA
 * for some period of time. It is up to each client to determine those spectra
 * it wishes to read from the CBE nodes by examining the metadata.
 *
 * The function is called by a vysmaw thread for subsets of spectrum metadata.
 * vysmaw clients should be aware that this function may be called very
 * frequently from a vysmaw thread, and the performance of vysmaw will be
 * affected by the time that is required to call this function. High performing
 * filter functions will perform minimal computation with good efficiency.
 *
 * The argument list of a vysmaw_spectrum_filter function comprises a sequence
 * of spectrum metadata, one element of user-supplied data, and a boolean-valued
 * output array that must be filled by this function. The metadata are provided
 * as a pair of station ids, a spectral window index, a polarization product
 * descriptor, an array of timestamps. Note that, for efficiency, the timestamps
 * are provided through 'struct vys_spectrum_info' values. 'num_infos' provides
 * the length of the 'infos' array, as well as the 'pass_filter' (output) array.
 * All elements in the 'pass_filter' array should be written by the function.
 * The element 'pass_filter[i]' should be set to 'true' if and only if the
 * client wishes to receive the data corresponding to 'infos[i]'.
